# GoodFirstIssue

Check out the prototype: www.goodfirstissue.com

The goal of this site is to help beginner and intermediate open-source contributors discover projects they can contribute to and get a better understanding of the open-source landscape in their preferred programming language. We do this by curating a list of repositories with issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted," and then organizing them into a ranked list. Users can also customize the list by adding their own labels to refine the results. 

# Current Status 

The website is currently functional and presentable with lots of room to grow. 

The site uses React.js and Jest/Enzyme for testing. 

# Contributing 

We welcome all contributions! While it's a good idea to open an issue before submitting code, it's not mandatory.

If you're searching for places to contribute, be sure to check out the ["issues labeled" "good first issue"][gfi]
